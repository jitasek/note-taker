## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I open the Note Taker, I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page, I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text, a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.

WHEN I click on the Save icon, the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.

WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column.

WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
